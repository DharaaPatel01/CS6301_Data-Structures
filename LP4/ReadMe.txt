Developers:

The zip file contains the following java files:
   - MDS.java
   - LP4Driver.java

Use the following commands in command line to compile the program:
   - cd into directory containing the package (one level above the package directory,
      uxk150630)
   - javac uxk150630/*.java

Once compiled, to run the LP4Driver code you can do either of the following:

   1) java uxk150630.LP4Driver lp4testcases/401.txt

      NOTE: lp4testcases is the folder of test cases provided to us. 401.txt was one of the test case files within the folder. You can change the testcase file to any file to do the testing. The testcases folder was not submitted as part of the final zipped project as they are from the professor anyways.

   2) java uxk150630.LP4Driver
   
      NOTE: This way you will have to input the test cases in the command line manually
